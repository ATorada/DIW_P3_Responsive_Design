## Installation

This example can be run on a server or without it.

The way to do it without it is:

```bash
  Double click the index.html
```

The way to do it with it is:

```bash
  Download the file and put it in the server resources location
```
## Lessons Learned

The challenges I found was how to reproduce the different results depending on the device I was looking at.

To solve this, I used the Media Queries with the Screen as a Media to make it, not only responsive, but well designed for the usual width/height devices like Tablets, Mobiles...
